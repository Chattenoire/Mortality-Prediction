Essential codes for my paper "Mortality Prediction Based on Federated Fuzzy Neural Network with Evolutionary Rule Mechanism"

Note:

Due to the sensitive nature of the MIMIC-IV dataset, which contains protected health information (PHI), the data preprocessing code and raw data transformations have been excluded from this repository. The preprocessing steps are detailed in the manuscript, and the code is available for review under the assumption that reviewers have access to the MIMIC-IV dataset via PhysioNet. Reviewers will need to follow the dataset access procedure outlined in the manuscript to obtain the necessary data for running the preprocessing steps.

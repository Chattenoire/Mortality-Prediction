Essential codes for my paper "Mortality Prediction Based on Federated Fuzzy Neural Network with Evolutionary Rule Mechanism"

Note:

Due to the sensitive nature of the MIMIC-IV dataset, which contains protected health information (PHI), the data preprocessing code and raw data transformations have been excluded from this repository. The preprocessing steps are detailed in the paper.
